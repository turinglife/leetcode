Data Structures

Array
Stack/Queue
Hashset/Hashmap/Hashtable/Dictionary
Tree/binary tree/balanced binary tree, complexity on time and storage.
Heap
Graph



You should know these data structures inside or outside.
What are the insertion/deletion/lookup characteristics?(O(logn) for a balanced binary tree)
what are the common caveats?(hashing is tricky, and usually takes O(k) time when k is the size of the object being hashed)
what algorithms tend to go along with each data structure?(Dijkstra's for a graph)
