Data Structures

Array
Stack/Queue
Hashset/Hashmap/Hashtable/Dictionary
Tree/binary tree/balanced binary tree, complexity on time and storage.
Heap
Graph



You should know these data structures inside or outside.
What are the insertion/deletion/lookup characteristics?(O(logn) for a balanced binary tree)
what are the common caveats?(hashing is tricky, and usually takes O(k) time when k is the size of the object being hashed)
what algorithms tend to go along with each data structure?(Dijkstra's for a graph)


code interview

Most important is the ability to write clean and correct code—it’s not enough just to be correct. A lot of people will be interacting with your code once you’re on the job, so it should be readable, maintainable, and extensible where appropriate.
