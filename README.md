Data Structures

Array
Stack/Queue
Hashset/Hashmap/Hashtable/Dictionary
Tree/binary tree/balanced binary tree, complexity on time and storage.
Heap
Graph



You should know these data structures inside or outside.
What are the insertion/deletion/lookup characteristics?(O(logn) for a balanced binary tree)
what are the common caveats?(hashing is tricky, and usually takes O(k) time when k is the size of the object being hashed)
what algorithms tend to go along with each data structure?(Dijkstra's for a graph)

Most important is the ability to write clean and correct code—it’s not enough just to be correct. A lot of people will be interacting with your code once you’re on the job, so it should be readable, maintainable, and extensible where appropriate.

Break the problem down and define abstractions. One crucial skill we look for is the ability to handle complexity by breaking problems into manageable sub-problems. For anything non-trivial, you’ll want to avoid writing one giant, monolithic function. Feel free to define helper functions, helper classes, and other abstractions to reach a working solution. You can leverage design patterns or other programming idioms as well. Ideally, your solution will be well-factored and as a result easy to read, understand, and prove correct.
